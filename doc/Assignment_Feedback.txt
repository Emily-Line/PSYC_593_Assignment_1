Very clear comments and answers. 
Nice visualization and the new codes tend to follow the tidyverse style. 
In line 387, the added column was named "Region", which has capitalization but honestly, 
didn't find anything else that was not in line. Definitely much clearer than my rendition of the code. 
It would have been nice to maybe printed the figures into the result folder, since you already had it?

The operators on lines 119-121 need spaces before and after. 
You may also want to add some extra spaces to align code elements; 
for example, on lines 157-159 and similar blocks of code. 
For the figures you may want to add the identity line to make it easier to 
identify that the scatterplots show larger values for one of the countries. 
Excellent work. All the modifications you included really help to get a more 
complete answer and easier to interpret results. Also, really good comments in your code.
